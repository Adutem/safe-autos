          Your vehicle can last for well over a decade with proper maintenance
          and repairs. Compared with the cost of purchasing a new vehicle, it
          pays to take good care of your car. Preventative maintenance will help
          you retain your car's condition longer, and it also helps you prevent
          unexpected automotive repairs. Regularly scheduled maintenance and
          lubrication using the manufacturer’s recommended intervals is the best
          way to proactively take care of your vehicle. Replacing normal
          wear-and-tear parts before they break is also a good path to follow on
          the road to long vehicle life.

              Your car’s engine is full of sensitive and delicate moving parts
              that rely on fluids like oil, transmission fluid, and coolant to
              function well. If you don’t keep an eye on these fluid levels or
              periodically change its filters, these delicate parts could face
              irreparable damage.

              Your car’s brakes also require brake fluid to transfers the force
              to the brakes to slow or stop your vehicle. It's possible for
              brake fluid to lose its effectiveness or for leaks to occur. If
              you experience abnormal brake performance, make sure to have your
              car checked.

              Coolant or antifreeze prevents overheating and freezing of the
              engine's cooling system. Like brake fluid, recommended service
              intervals vary by manufacturer and can range from roughly a few
              years to a recommended check during every scheduled maintenance
              service. Keep an eye on your coolant level to ensure there aren't
              any leaks. If you ever see the engine temperature warning light
              turn on, there might be something wrong with your coolant or the
              amount of coolant remaining.

              Your vehicle’s brakes should be examined at least once a year to
              identify any wear and tear and need for repair. Brake pads and
              rotors typically last anywhere from 35,000 to 60, 000 miles
              depending on how often you stop while driving and how thin or
              thick the rotors and pads are initially

              Your car’s battery typically lasts 4-5 years, depending on outdoor
              temperature, driving frequency, and overall use among other
              influences. To maximize battery life, keep your battery clean;
              don't leave your car unused for an extended period, and don't
              forget to shut off the interior lights and headlights when your
              car isn't in use.

              Driving with bad headlights can be very dangerous. Restoring your
              headlights can have it looking like new and can shine up to 3.4x
              lighter when driving. You can slow oxidation caused by heat,
              sunlight, pollution, and harsh chemicals by parking in a garage
              when possible.

              A car’s wheels and tires are essential to the safety and
              performance of your vehicle. Inspect your tires and wheels
              regularly for symptoms such as low inflation pressure, uneven wear
              patterns, or excessive wear. You should also take time to keep
              them at the proper pressure for better fuel economy.
